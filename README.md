# springboot2essentials

This is a course-inspired project for educational purposes on my journey to learn about Spring-Boot with essential topics. This is the second version, better and more complete than the first "springbootessentials" which is also in this gitHub profile. The original code was done by DevDojo. Using Spring Boot 2.6.4, Spring Security, MySql and SpringDoc OpenApi.

Feito atraves do curso 'Spring Boot Essentials 2' por DevDojo, melhor e mais atualizado que 'Spring Boot Essentials' que tambem esta neste repositorio. Usando Spring Boot 2.6.4, Spring Security, MySql e SpringDoc OpenApi.
